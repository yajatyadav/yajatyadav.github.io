    <h1>Project 2: Fun with Filters and Frequencies!</h1>
    <h2> Background</h2>
    <p>This project looks at various uses of filters and frequencies in image processing. First, we look at taking
        the partial derivatives and gradients of images. We then highlight the Derivative of Gaussian (DoG) filter, and
        how
        it allows us to both smooth and take derivatives with a single convolution.</p>

    <p>
        Then, by picking out the low and high frequency components of images, we are able to create a image sharpening
        filter,
        as well as combine the low/high frequency components of 2 differernt images to create hybrid images- images that
        change in interpretation
        based on viewing distance.
    </p>

    <p>
        We conclude by implementing Gaussian and Laplacian stacks, which then enables us to utilize multiresolution
        blending to compute a gentle seam between two images,
        allowing us to smoothly blend together images.
    </p>

    <h2> Part 1: Fun With Filters </h2>
    <h3> Part 1.1: Finite Difference Operator</h3>
    <p> Convolving an image with the D_x and D_y kernels allows us to produce the partial derivative in x and in y.
        We apply these to the cameraman image. Convolving with D_x allows us to see vertical edges, while convolving
        with D_y allows us to see horizontal edges.
        We are then able to create an edge image by using these partial derivatives im_dX and im_dY to compute the
        gradient magnitude = np.sqrt(im_dX ** 2 + im_dY ** 2)
        Finally, to get a clean black/white edge image, we binarize the gradient magnitudes by setting a threshold=0.3
        Pixels above are set to 1, while those below to 0.

    <h3> Part 1.2: Derivative of Gaussian (DoG) Filter</h3>
    <p> Here, we first blur the image through convolution with a 2D Gaussian, and then apply the process in 1.1 to
        create an edge image.This way, we can remove some of the noise.
        With the rule of thumb being to set the half-width of the kernel to be approximately 3*sigma for our gaussian 2D
        filter,
        I went with sigma=2, k=12. To create the 2D Gaussian, we can simply take the outer product of a 1D Gaussian and
        its transpose.
        Compared to the result of 1.1, we see that blurring the image first reduces noise in the final edge image, but
        also leads to a bit blurrier edges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, we show that the above can be accomplished with 1 convolution! By pre-computing (gaussian_2D * dX) and
        (gaussian_2D * dY),we can directly use the resulting kernel to both smooth and take partial derivatives at the
        same time (this follows from the associativity of the convolution operation)! The results, as seen in the 2nd
        row, are the exact same as the first row!
    </p>

    <p>
        For all convolution operations in this project, I chose mode = "same" in order to retain the original image's
        size.
        For boundary, I picked "symm", as reflecting the boundary pxiels for padding purposes produced the nicest image
        compared to other padding methods.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Answers to Questions from Part 1.2: </b> 1) Compared to the output of 1.1, we see that blurring the
        image first
        reduces noise in the final edge image, but also leads to a bit blurrier edges.
        2) We notice that creating a derivative of gaussian filters first, and then convolving these with the image,
        yields the same results as the previous part. This is because convolution is associative, so (img * gauss) *
        deriv = img * (gauss * deriv). The final images look identical, and also have the same threshold value of 0.05.

    <h2> Part 2: Fun With Frequencies!</h2>
    <h3> Part 2.1: Image "Sharpening"</h3>
    <p> The idea in this part is to sharpen an image by enhancing its high frequency components.
        An easy way to obtain the high frequency components is by subtracting the low frequencies from the image,
        and we can quickly get the low frequencies using the 2D Gaussian filter as a low-pass filter.
        Then, we can add back these high-frequencies into our original image, weighted by a "sharpening coefficient"
        alpha.
        The higher alpha is, the stronger the higher frequencies will be in the final image.
        If alpha is too high, however, the image may look too noisy and have artifacts - thus, we can qualitatively tune
        alpha, and I have listed the "best" alpha for each image below.
        Because the Gaussian filter is 2D, I perform this operation for each color channel separately and then combine
        them together.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the low-pass Gaussian filter, I picked sigma=1, k=6, following the same rule of thumb.
    </p>

    <h4> Sharpening Eagle, Best Alpha = 5</h4>
    <p> This eagle image might have had a higher alpha because it contains a lot of higher-frequency components like the
        edges in the white fur, which would be further enhanced by a higher alpha. For higher alphas, we see the
        background sky become noisy.

    <h4> Evaluation: Resharpening a Blurred Image </h4>
    <p> To test the effectivness of this sharpening filter, we first start with an image, blur it, and then try to
        sharpen the blurred image.
        As we can see, after tweaking the alpha value to alpha=3, the resulting resharpened image looks pretty close to
        the
        original image, although it has does some issues like extra noise in the grass in front of the tiger.

    <h3> Part 2.2: Hybrid Images</h3>
    <p> Here, we create hybrid images - images that change in interpretation based on viewing distance. Because higher
        frequencies tend to dominate human perception for closer distances,
        if we create an image by blending the high frequency components of im1 and the low frequency components of im2,
        we get a hybrid image- this image appears like im2 from a distance, but more like im1 closer up.
        We start by creating a hybrid image of Derek and his cat Nutmeg.
        The cutoff-frequencies for both the low and high pass was chosen after some experimentation, and this was used
        to set the Gaussians' k and sigma values.
        Then, I created 3 additional hybrid images, where each pair explores a different concept (different faces,
        hanges over time, etc.), and I perform a frequency analysis for one of them.
        This analysis involves looking at the log-magnitude of the Fourier transform of the various images in the
        process (original, low-freq, high-freq, combined). The final pair is a failure scenario, where the hybrid image
        did not turn as good,
        despite a lot of tuning with the cutoff frequencies.
        Finally, for the Bells & Whistles, I explore the impact of including color in the low and/or
        high frequency components by using the Derek and Nutmeg hybrid image as an example.

        different distances, the image just looks like both a dolphin and a toucan at all distances.
        Some reasons may be because the animals aren't aligned, they are too different from each other, and their
        frequency contents are in the human visual range but still very distinct from each other.

    <h4>Bells and Whistles: Impact of Color, Using Derek and Nutmeg</h4>
    <p> I found that including color just for the high-frequency image (and keeping the low one in grayscale) worked
        best in creating the hybrid effect. This supports what we learned in lecture, that
        cones are more sensitive to higher frequencies than rods. All images above were generated with only the high
        frequencies colored. My hybrid_image() function has a string parameter mode, which can be
        "grayscale", "color_high", "color_low", or "color_both". Using this and keeping all other parameters fixed, I
        show the results of the 4 modes ith Derek and Nutmeg below. Qualitatively, using "color_high" produces the best
        hybrid images.

    <h3> Part 2.3: Gaussian and Laplacian Stacks</h3>
    <p> In this part, we implement the Gaussian and Laplacian stacks. A stack is like a pyramid without the subsampling
        step.
        Thus, in the Gaussian stack, each subsequent image is produced by blurring the current image but not
        subsampling.
        To produce the laplacian stack, an element i is produced by subtracting the (i+1)th entry of the Gaussian stack
        from the ith entry of the Gaussian stack.
        Effectively, each entry in the Laplacian stack stores the high frequencies that were removed from the
        corresponding Gaussian stack's entry due to blurring.
        Thus, the first Laplacian entry would store a band of the highest frequencies, the next entry would store a band
        of the second highest frequencies, and so on.
        The Gaussian and Laplacian stacks for both the apple and orange are visualized below. In the next part, we will
        use these to create the Oraple!

    <h3> Part 2.4: Multiresolution Blending</h3>
    <p> In this part, we utilize the guassiand laplacian stacks from above to smoothly seam 2 images together!
        To recreate the Oraple, we use these stacks in the following manner: because weighted interpolation is
        "smooth" only when the 2 images contain a small band of frequencies, we can effectively seam together the orange
        and apple images from each level of the laplacian. We must also repeat this process for the very last entries of
        both the apple
        and orange gaussians,
        as these represent the lowest frequencies not captured by our laplacian stack.
        Once we have this stack of nicely-seamed images, we can then simply add them to get the oracle.
        At each level, when we seam, we use a blurrier and blurrier version of the mask filter.
    <p> To get a nicer seam, I use larger Gaussian and Laplacian stacks compared to 2.3, as seen below. Please scroll
        horizontally to see the full stacks. </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        I repeat this process of multiresolution blending with 2 other pairs of images- the first uses a horizontal
        seam, while the second uses an irregular mask. In order to get a good seam, I also manually the crop/resize the
        images beforehand.
    </p>
    <h4> Bells and Whistles</h4>
    <p> I implement all of the multiresolution blending described above in color - this involves performing the
        operations on each color channel and then combining the results.</p>

    <h2> Takeaways From This Project</h2>
    <p> The most important thing I learned from this project was connecting the math of low/high frequencies, to what
        they visually look like! I better understand how edges in images
        can lead to higher frequency components, how the background content is genereally the lower-frequency, and other
        ideas about how frequencies in images look like visually. </p>
