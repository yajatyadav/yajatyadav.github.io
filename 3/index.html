    <h1> Project 3: Face Morphing</h1>
    <h2> Background </h2>
    <p> In this project, I start by producing a morph animation of my face into George's face. In order to do this, I
        first
        select corresponding points using the web tool. I then average these points for me and George to get an average
        shape. I perform Delauny triangulation on this average shape, and this triangulation is used for all subsequent
        parts relating to this morph.
        I visualize the correspondences, as well as the triangulation and its overlay on me/George's face.
        Then, I am able to use these results in order to implement a more general morph() function, which allows me to
        slowly transition from Image A to Image B.
        I use this morph function to create a GIF morphing my face to George's.
    </p>
    <p> In the next part of the project, I use the Brazil Face Database, and work with the subset of images that have a
        neutral facial expression. Using this dataset,
        I find the mean face shape, morph various faces to this shape, as well as find the mean face. I also add
        correspondences on my face, and use these to 1) warp my face into the mean face shape and 2) warp the mean face
        into my geometry
    </p>

    <p> Finally, by simply allowing the warp_frac and dissolve_frac parameters to go above 1, I am able to start at the
        population mean desscribed above and extrapolate from it, thus creating a caricature of my face.</p>

    <p> I conclude with implementing one of the Bells and Whistles, as described below.</p>

    <h2> Part 1: Defining Correspondences </h2>
    <p> As part of a smooth morph, we must define corresponding features between the two images, such as noses, eyes,
        hairline, etc. This way, these components nicely deform from the source to the target.
        I use the web <a href="https://cal-cs180.github.io/fa23/hw/proj3/tool.html"> interface </a> to label points and
        export the JSON. However, at the start of my code, I do reverse the order in which the JSON file stores the
        im1Points and im2Points lists, so that the data is compatible with the rest of my code.
    </p>

    <p> Then, I use the two image_point lists to compute an average face shape, and perform Delauny triangulation on
        this average shape. This way, I can ensure that my triangles aren't too skinny, and by using the average, to
        lessen their potential deformations.
    </p>

    <p> Below, I have visualized: 1) the starting correspondences between me and George, 2) overlaying the average
        shape's triangulation over my face and points, 4) overlaying the triangulation over
        George's face and points</p>

    <h2> Part 2: Computing the "Mid-Way Face"</h2>
    <p> In this part, I implemented the mid_way_face function, which takes in two face and returns the mid-way face.
        Computing the average shape was easy and something I had already done when finding the triangulations. The next
        step was warping each face to the average shape, and this required the most work. Finally, we cross-dissolve the
        two warped images to get the final mid-way image.
        Here are the detailed steps I took to accomplis thish:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Implement compute_affine(tri1_points, tri2_points): this function finds the 3x3 affine transformation matrix
            that deforms triangle_1 to triangle_2. I accomplished this by first finding a change of basis matrix to go
            from triangle_1 to the "standard triangle" ( vertices at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1)), and then a matrix to go from
            the standard triangle to triangle_2. Then, composing these matrices gives us the final A matrix. In order to
            not be restricted to linear maps (and be able to get an affine transformation), I added a 3rd "dummy"
            dimension and set it to 1 for all vectors involved.
        </li>
        <li>
            When warping im to avg, first find the A matrix. Then, use inverse-warping with A_inv to obtain an array of
            "source points" needed for us to determine the color at each target image pixel (the target is avg here).
        </li>
        <li>
            This array of source points was filled with decimals, so I used bilinear interpolation in order to get a
            nice combination of source pixel values.
            Further, since I only wanted the current iteration's triangle to matter, the "source image" for
            interpolation was created by applying a polygon mask over the original image.
        </li>
        <li> I used skimage.draw.polygon to enable the polygon masking I mentioned above.

        </li>
        <li>
            The process in steps 1-4 was repeated for each triangle in order to implement warp_image_to_avg(...). Then,
            I
            could simply use this function twice to warp both my face and George's face to the average shape.
        </li>

        <li>
            After the above warping was done, cross-dissolving was straigthforward- just average the 2 warped images,
            giving us the final mid-way face.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Part 3: The Morph Sequence</h2>
    <p> In this part, I utilize the work from the previous part to allow us to have a smooth morphing animation from
        Yajat to George. Essentially, I utilized my warp_image_to_avg function from part 2 to implement this part's
        morph() function. I used warp_frac to take a convex combination of im1 and im2, and this served as our "average"
        image from before.
        This way, we could use reuse the methods from before to warp each image to this "average" shape. Then, for the
        cross-dissolve stage, I just used dissolve_frac to take a convex combination of these warped images, giving us
        any arbitrary morphed image in the sequence from Yajat to George. To get the nice animation from Yajat to
        George, I created 46 frames, where I used a
        linear strategy: frame i was created by calling morph() with warp_frac = dissolve_frac = i/45. I then saved this
        as a GIF, displayed below. The first and last frames in the GIF are shown for 1s, then the rest of the GIF runs
        at 30 FPS.
    </p>

    <h2> Part 4: The "Mean face" of a population</h2>
    <p>
        In this part, I chose the Brazil Face Dataset, and focused on the subset of faces with a neutral facial
        expression. I first found the average face shape with an identical method as part 1 - I simply averaged each
        face's keypoint data to get the average shape. However, to improve the warping in the previous step, I also
        added four corner points at each image- I did this by simply looping through all the .pts file and appending the
        same 4 points for each file.
    </p>
    <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="media/brazil_average_shape.png">
                <p>Average Face Shape of Brazil Neutral Expression Dataset</p>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p> Next, I morphed each image in the dataset to this average shape, using the warp_image_to_avg function from
        before. I have highlighted the morphing results for a few faces below.</p>
    <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="media/brazil_original_1.png">

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="media/brazil_original_4.png">

        <tr></tr>
        <td>

            <p>Morphed to Average Shape</p>
        </td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <p> Next, I computed the average face of the population through a similar process- after morphing ALL faces in the
        dataset to the average shape, cross-dissolving all of these morphed images with equal weight to each image gave
        me the final average face for this dataset. Below is the average Brazilian face (neutral expression), as well as
        with
        its correspondences.
    </p>

    <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="media/brazil_average_face_plain.png">

                <p>Average Face with its Correspondences</p>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p> Finally, I show the following two results: 1) warping my face into the average face geometry for this dataset
        found above, and 2) warping the average face above into my face's geometry. These steps required me to manually
        label correspondences on my face that match the structure of the point correspondces in the brazil dataset, and
        I accomplished this using by using "1a.jpg" as a reference image and using it to select points on my face using
        the web tool.
    </p>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2> Part 5: Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean</h2>
    <p> In this part, I use the Brazilian face mean I calculate earlier and extrapolate from it. This can be done by
        simply allowing dissolve_frac and warp_frac to go above 1 (or below 0) in my morph() function. This way, I am
        able to move extra in the
        direction of my face -> average Brazilian face, but go "beyond" the endpoint, thus extrapolating.Because the
        brazil dataset is in black and white, I also convert my image to grayscale so that the cross-dissolve is nicer.
        Below are a few extrapolations, as well as their corresponding warp_frac and dissolve_frac values.
    </p>

    <h2> Bells and Whistles: Changing Gender and Ethnicity</h2>
    <p> Following the same ideas from before, in this part, I change my face's gender and ethnicity. In order to do so,
        I first got the average Indian woman face and average French man face from this <a
            href=" https://leadingpersonality.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/average-faces-of-men-and-women-around-the-world/">
            website</a>. For each image, I show morph animations, where 1) only the shape is morphed, 2) only the
        appearance is morphed (cross-dissolving), and 3) both are morphed. I resized and adjusted these images to match
        my existing yajat.png image. I then do the
        following: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Change my gender: Because I am an Indian-American man, in order to just change my gender, I use the average
            face of an Indian woman. Similar to parts 1-3 above, I first find the triangulation on the average shape,
            and then use the morph() method with im1 = yajat and im2=average_indian_woman to generate the morphing
            animations. By varying whether warp_frac and/or dissolve_frac are allowed to vary over time, I can generate
            the 3
            animations described above (if warp_frac = 0 always, we are only morphing the appearance; if dissolve_frac =
            0 always, we
            are only morphing the shape; if both non-zero, we are morphing using both)
            I used the web tool to label the average Indian woman face's features, using the same
            correspondences as those of the starting yajat image's points. I also used an online GIF tool to make some
            minor tweaks to the output animations, like making the first and last frames hold for longer.
        </li>
        <li> Similarly, change my ethnicity: Here, I use the average face of a French man. Again, I find the
            triangulation on the average shape, and use the morph() method with im1= yajat and im2=average_french_man to
            generate the morphing animations from above. I used the web tool to label the average French man face's
            features in an
            identical fashion as described above.</li>
    </ol>
